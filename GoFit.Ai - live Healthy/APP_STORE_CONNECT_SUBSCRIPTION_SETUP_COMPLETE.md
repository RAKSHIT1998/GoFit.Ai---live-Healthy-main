# Complete App Store Connect Subscription Setup Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Product IDs
Your app uses these **exact** product IDs (must match exactly in App Store Connect):
- **Monthly**: `com.gofitai.premium.monthlyy` - $1.99/month
- **Yearly**: `com.gofitai.premium.yearlyyy` - $19.99/year

**Note**: The yearly ID has three 'y's at the end (`yearlyyy`) - this is intentional based on your App Store Connect subscription group requirements.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Product IDs match exactly:
   - Code: `com.gofitai.premium.monthlyy` and `com.gofitai.premium.yearlyyy`
   - App Store Connect: Must be identical
2. Check subscription status in App Store Connect (should be "Ready to Submit" or "Approved")
3. Verify bundle identifier: `com.rakshit.gofitai`
4. Wait 24-48 hours after creating subscriptions (Apple needs time to propagate)
5. Test in Sandbox mode first

### Issue: "Subscription not found"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure both subscriptions are in the **same Subscription Group**
- Check that subscriptions are **approved** or **ready for review**
- Verify Product IDs have no typos (especially the triple 'y' in yearly: `yearlyyy`)

### Issue: App Review Rejection - Missing Subscription Info

**Solutions:**
- Ensure `PaywallView` displays:
  - Subscription title
  - Subscription length (month/year)

  - Terms of Use link (working)
  - Privacy Policy link (working)

### Issue: "Invalid Product ID"

**Solutions:**
- Product IDs must:

  - Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens
  - Not contain spaces or special characters
  - Match exactly between code and App Store Connect

---

## Step 10: After Approval

Once subscriptions are approved:

1. **Test with Real Purchases** (small amount):
   - Make a test purchase with a real account
   - Verify subscription activates correctly
   - Check subscription status updates

2. **Monitor in App Store Connect**:
   - Go to **"Sales and Trends"** to see subscription metrics
   - Monitor subscription renewal rates
   - Track subscription cancellations

3. **Server-Side Validation** (if implemented):
   - Verify receipts on your backend
   - Handle subscription status changes
   - Sync subscription status with your database

4. **Handle Expiration Gracefully**:
   - Show paywall when trial/subscription expires
   - Allow users to restore purchases
   - Provide clear messaging about subscription benefits
